<h1>About me</h1>
<p>
I studied at St John's University in Queens, NY. I received a Bachelors in Health Science in the spring of 2021.
I used HTML, CSS, Javascript, Python, PHP, and Wordpress to build websites as a freelance web developer.
I wanted to solve real world problems and become a competent Software Developer.
So I completed a marathon paced 12 month Coding Bootcamp at Code Immersives, which focused on Fullstack Web Development.
Simultaneously, I enrolled in a guided study program with Amazon Academy Cloud foundations to understand Amazon cloud services and get AWS certifications.
I am continually seeking opportunities to become proficient with new technologies.
