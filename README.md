<h1>About me</h1>
<p>
I initially learned web design from my mentor Stefan Mischook. I used HTML, CSS, Javascript, Python, PHP, and Wordpress skills to build secure websites.
I realized I needed a software engineering internship or apprenticeship program to solve real world problems, add value to end users around the world, and become a competent engineer. 
I completed a marathon paced 12 month Coding Bootcamp at Code Immersives, which focused on Fullstack Web Development. 
Simultaneously, I learned cloud services fundamentals through Amazon Academy Cloud foundations for six months then passed my Entry level Cloud Practitioner certification (CCP).
One of my favorite powerful AWS services is Amazon S3 Object Lock. This feature allows me to store my business objects using a write once, read many (WORM) model. 
It is a powerful cloud storage tool that can keep a secure copy of business records for later auditing.
Now I am applying to entry level Fullstack Development or Software engineering positions. 
I have strong interests in Virtual Machines (VMWare, etc.), Information Assurance (Cybersecurity), and Cloud Native API Design (Amazon Web Services).

<p>I studied at St John's University in Queens, NY. I received a Bachelors in Health Science in the summer of 2021.</p>
